# Final_Project - Predicting Forest Fires

# Provisional Mock Machine Learning Model

## Data Source: 
https://wildfire.alberta.ca/resources/historical-data/historical-wildfire-database.aspx 

## Machine Learning Model: 
Based on the data, the mock machine learning model is looking at predicting the change from the starting fire size and the discovered fire size by the number of days it took for the fire to grow. Essentially in the real world, we would like to find out if there is a relationship between the number of days that have passed from the start of the fire to when it was discovered with the growth of the fire size before it has been classified as being under control. Wild fires have been increasingly devastating in many countries over the years. If we could build an accurate model, this could potentially provide a crucial time period of when a fire could be under control. 

## Reason for Model Choice
As the data used for the features and output contains continous data, Linear Regression has been chosen to test the sample data.
